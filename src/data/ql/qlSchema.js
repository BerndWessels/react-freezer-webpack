/* Ways to get the data:
1. Individual SQL queries for each node.
   Currently we basically make a query on each instantiated data node.
   This results in a lot of individual sql select statements.
2. A single sql query at the root only.
   We could only dynamically build a single query at root level based on the ql query with joins to get all the data.
   Then each node (resolve) would find its requested data within this big dataset.
3. A single no-sql query at the root only.
   If the root node translates to a no-sql object we could just query this at the root node.
   Then each node (resolve) would find its requested data within the no-sql object tree.
